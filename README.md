AI Agent Automation with n8n
This repository contains two AI-powered agents developed using n8n, designed to simplify and automate creative and business communication tasks.

🚀 Project Overview
1. Storytelling AI Agent
A dynamic AI agent that generates engaging stories based on user input. Simply provide a theme or idea, and the agent crafts a unique story, ideal for content creators, marketers, or anyone looking to bring their ideas to life.

2. Business Email Writing AI Agent
An intelligent agent that automates business email generation. By entering just the company name, email address, and a brief description, this agent drafts professional emails tailored to the context — saving time and ensuring clarity in outreach efforts.
